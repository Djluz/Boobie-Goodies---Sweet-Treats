                <p id="content">
                    Being a mother is something most women dream of from a young age 
                    and the years leading up to this time we create plans to how we want 
                    this journey to play out. We have an idea of what age we want to have 
                    kids, sometimes it happens earlier or for others it doesn't happen so 
                    easily. We create a "birth plan" for how we want the birth to take 
                    place but you ask any mother, the birth never goes exactly to plan 
                    whether the baby decides to come earlier or later than the due date 
                    or you end up having a c-section when you wanted a natural birth. 
                    Then once you have your bundle of joy in your arms we think that 
                    because breastfeeding is such a natural process between a mother 
                    and a baby that it happens with ease but again this is something 
                    that can again not always goes to plan for some women.

                    The best advice that we can give is to have an open mind. Make your 
                    plans, be excited and strive to achieve your desires but be lenient. 
                    Babies come with a whole lot of unexpected surprises and your new 
                    journey is about adapting to what suits you both best. There isn't 
                    one right way to do anything in parenting. We take our journey and 
                    we make it our own and work with what we are given but it does help 
                    to be prepared for all the curve balls that are thrown at you. So, 
                    here are some helpful tips with breastfeeding in which may help 
                    prepare you for the most amazing journey of your life.<br><br>
                    We hope you've decided to at least give breastfeeding a go. 
                    Even if you only nurse your baby for a few days or weeks, that 
                    early milk, called colostrum, provides an important source of 
                    antibodies to protect against diseases as baby's own immune system 
                    develops during the first year.

                            Plan to breastfeed about 8 to 12 times in every 24-hour period. 
                            Your baby is good at giving hunger signals: rooting around searching for your nipple; 
                            putting their hand in their mouth; and looking increasingly alert. 
                            Always feed on demand.

                            until breastfeeding is well established. The thrusting motion required to breastfeed 
                            is different from that required to suck a nipple, and baby could get confused.

                            body can be more sensitive to dehydration. This means that it is important to keep 
                            up your water intake throughout the day, especially during feeding times, 
                            so be sure to keep a bottle nearby at all times. It is not always easy,

                            dont need that! A good way to check your hydration level is by looking at the colour of your urine. 
                            If its clear or light coloured, you are probably sufficiently hydrated. Check out our range of drink 
                            bottles made especially for breastfeeding mothers with a helpful reminder to “Drink up mummy!”.

                            Breastfeed in a calm environment to help your milk let down. After a while, all it will take for 
                            your milk to let down is unhooking your bra for your baby, or even just hearing any infant cry 
                            and you will get to know the feeling of your let down too. So when it's about to hit, 
                            get that baby on there or duck for cover because it's going to start spraying.

                            smooth Boobie Balm or an alternative nipple balm over your nipples after each nursing session; 
                            and let your nipples air dry after each nursing session. Also, alternate which breast you 
                            start on for each session.  You should also not hear any clicking or sucking sound. 
                            If you do, the baby isn't positioned right. Bring baby closer to you, and hold their head 
                            firmly so the mouth covers as much of the areola as possible.

                            Warm compresses, letting warm water run over your breasts in the shower, or laying cabbage 
                            leaves on your breasts can help relieve some of the pressure but be sure not to leave it on 
                            for longer that 10mins as this can dry up your milk. You can also try hand expressing some 
                            milk between feeds but only enough to ease the discomfort, expressing more could promote 
                            your body to produce more than needed.

                            If you feel like you have the flu and one breast is red, hot and sore, you may have mastitis. 
                            Get in touch with your midwife or GP immediately. In the meantime, keep nursing and/or pumping 
                            on that side as much as you can. To prevent mastitis, make sure you empty your breasts regularly. 
                            If you do take antibiotics, add a probiotic (good bacteria such as lactobacillus) supplement, 
                            or eat a container of live culture yogurt every day, to help prevent the next complication: thrush.

                            Thrush is a fungal infection that can form on the breast and be passed between your breast and 
                            the baby's mouth. Overly moist breasts, sore or cracked nipples, following a diet high in sugar 
                            or yeasty foods or taking antibiotics, birth control pills or steroids can all throw your body's 
                            natural yeast levels out of control and lead to thrush. Symptoms are very sore nipples, achy or 
                            painful breasts or pink, flaky, shiny, itchy or cracked nipples.Your baby may have little white 
                            spots in their mouth, or a diaper rash that won't heal. You will need to treat both your breasts 
                            and the baby's mouth with a prescription anti-fungal or with the over the counter anti-fungal 
                            gentian violet. To prevent thrush, air dry your nipples, use breast pads in your bra, wear a 
                            clean bra every day, and reduce the amount of sugar and yeasty products in your diet.

                            <a id="bold">Tongue tie.</a>
                            Tongue-tie is a medical condition that affects many people, and has special implications for the 
                            breastfed baby. The medical term for the condition known as tongue-tie is “ankyloglossia”. 
                            It results when the frenulum (the band of tissue that connects the bottom of the tongue to the 
                            floor of the mouth) is too short and tight, causing the movement of the tongue to be restricted. 
                            In order to extract milk from the breast, the baby needs to move their tongue forward to cup the 
                            nipple and areola, drawing it back in their mouth and pressing the tissue against the roof of the 
                            mouth. The tongue plays an important role in breastfeeding, and if the babys frenulum is so short 
                            that their tongue cant extend over the lower gum, they may end up compressing the breast tissue 
                            between their gums while they nurses, which can cause nipple soreness or damage. Contact your midwife, 
                            plunket consultant or GP if you have any concerns.

                            Breastfeeding is a basic supply and demand activity. The more you nurse, the more milk your body makes. Feed baby whenever they demand and let them continue sucking even when you feel that your breasts are empty.

                <p id="content">
                    Before you fret about your milk supply know that if you are exclusively breastfeeding 
                    (i.e. your baby is consuming nothing but your breastmilk) around the clock (day and night) 
                    and your baby is gaining weight, whether they are in the 99th or 1st percentile in weight 
                    compared to other babies, then you have you a full milk supply suited perfectly for your 
                    little one so our treats are simply a tasty, nutritious reward for you through your busy day 
                    and let's be honest at night too. Remember, breastfeeding is a basic supply-and-demand activity. 
                    The more you nurse, the more milk your body makes. If you are concerned please consult with 
                    your midwife, GP or contact your local lactation consultant which can be found at
